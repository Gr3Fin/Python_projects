**NOTE**:
1. Due to constant changes in offers on websites like this it may be necessary to update  
search options with time (like the URL the data is scraped from).  
2. At first, create a Google Form on Google Drive as Short answer  
  and put the link to the Form in form_fill.py  
3. Comment the part of code with browser window open/close if desired.
